# Hi, I'm Aiden Gindin ðŸ‘‹

I build bridges between messy data systems.

At Fidelity, I've wrangled Kafka streams with runtime schema handling, automated schema validation across Oracle and CockroachDB, and refactored monolithic Java services to handle data flows they were never designed for.

Looking to relocate to NYC or work remote for companies that need someone to own ambiguous integration projects end-to-end.

## What I work with

- **Languages:** Java, Python, Scala, TypeScript, Go, Rust
- **Systems:** Spark, Kafka, Spring Boot, CockroachDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, AWS, Docker, Jenkins, NixOS

## Featured projects

Here are some highlights from my [portfolio](/pages/portfolio):

### intervals-search

Natural-language search for workout data using OpenRouter.
Ask "show me hard bike rides from last month" and get filtered results from [intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu).
FastAPI backend, React frontend.
Built to explore LLM and MCP integration patterns - and to remind myself why I stick to backend work.

[Code](https://github.com/aidengindin/intervals-search)

### NixOS homelab

Declarative infrastructure across multiple hosts with encrypted secrets (agenix), automated backups (Restic), and secure remote access (Tailscale).
Everything is code - service configs, network topology, secrets management.
